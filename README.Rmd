The `flexCausal` R package enables estimation of Average Causal Effects (ACE) for a broad class of graphical models that satisfy the treatment primal fixability criterion. Briefly, the package accepts a dataset and a causal graph—defined through nodes, directed edges, and bi-directed edges—as input and provides causal effect estimates using robust influence-function-based estimators developed in [this paper](http://www.arxiv.org/pdf/2409.03962).

> The package asks for the following **inputs** from the user:  
> 
>- Dataset
>
>- Treatment and outcome specifications
>
>- ADMG (acyclic directed mixed graph), a projection of directed acyclic graphs (DAG) with latent variables. This can be based on expert knowledge, causal discovery methods, or a combination of both.

  
  
> The package **outputs**:  
> 
>- Whether the causal effect is identifiable
>
>- The estimated causal effect with confidence intervals (if the causal effect is identifiable under primal fixability criterion). Users can specify either one-step or TMLE estimators, or choose to use both.
> Additionally, they can select methods for nuisance parameter estimation, with SuperLearner set as the default.
>
>- An assessment of whether the specified ADMG is nonparametrically saturated, and if current estimates reach the semiparametric efficiency bounds.

Here's a schematic view of what `flexCausal` is capable of and how it works:

# A Brief Introduction to ADMGs
The ADMG is one of the major input to the `flexCausal` package. It is a projection of a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) with unmeasured variables into only observed variables. Let $G(O \cup U)$ denote a DAG with observed variables $O$ and unmeasured variables $U$. The ADMG is a projection of $G(O \cup U)$ onto $O$ only, denoted as $G(O)$. The projection is guided by the following rules:
  
1. $O_i \ \blue{\rightarrow} \ O_j$ is included in the ADMG $G(O)$ if $O_i \ \blue{\rightarrow} \ O_j$ exists in $G(O \cup U)$ or if a directed path from $O_i$ to $O_j$ exists that passes through only unmeasured variables in $G(O \cup U)$.
2. $V_i \ \red{\leftrightarrow} \ V_j$ is included in the ADMG $G(O)$ if a collider-free path, like $V_i \ \blue{\leftarrow} \cdots \blue{\rightarrow} \ V_j$, exists in $G(O \cup U)$ where all the intermediate variables belong to $U$.

See Examples (a) and (b), where the DAGs with unmeasured variables on the left are projected onto their corresponding ADMGs on the right:
![](illustrative_examples.jpeg)

In all the following discussions, we will use the ADMG in example (a) above as a running example. The packages comes with simulated datasets `data_example_a` and `data_example_b` that are generated from the ADMGs in examples (a) and (b), respectively. Let’s take a look at the first few rows of `data_example_a`:

```{r, load-pkg, warning=F, message=F}

library(flexCausal) # load the package

head(data_example_a) # take a glance of the data, which is a simulated dataset under above figure (a).

```

Note that the $M$ variable in the dataset is a multivariate variable, consisting of two components, $M.1$ and $M.2$. To input the ADMG into the `flexCausal` package, users need to specify the *vertices*, *directed edges*, and *bi-directed edges* in the ADMG, along with the components of any *multivariate variables*.  

For example, to input the ADMG in example (a) above that aligns with the simulated dataset, we would create a graph object with the `make.graph()` function:

```{r, eval=T, warning=F, message=F}

# create a graph object for the ADMG in example (a)
graph_a <- make.graph(vertices=c('A','M','L','Y','X'), # specify the vertices
                bi_edges=list(c('A','Y')), # specify the bi-directed edges
                di_edges=list(c('X','A'), c('X','M'), c('X','L'),c('X','Y'), c('M','Y'), c('A','M'), c('A','L'), c('M','L'), c('L','Y')), # specify the directed edges, with each pair of variables indicating an directed edge from the first variable to the second. For example, c('X', 'A') represents a directed edge from X to A.
                multivariate.variables = list(M=c('M.1','M.2'))) # specify the components of the multivariate variable M

```

With this graph object in hand, we can conveniently explore various properties of the ADMG using functions provided in the package. These functions include topological ordering, genealogical relations, and causal effect identifiability, and etc. For a detailed discussion, see [Functions for learning the properties of ADMG]. 

As a quick example, we can obtain the adjacency matrix of this ADMG with the `f.adj_matrix()` function:

```{r, eval=T, warning=F, message=F}

f.adj_matrix(graph_a) # get the adjacency matrix of the ADMG in example (a)

```


# Quick Start on Estimation

The main function in this package is `ADMGtmle()`, which estimates the Average Causal Effect (ACE) using both a one-step corrected plug-in estimator and a TMLE estimator. To get a sense of how to use this package, we provide a quick example below. We will use the ADMG in example (a) above to estimate the ACE of treatment $A$ on outcome $Y$ using a simulated dataset `data_example_a`. We can directly use the `graph_a` object created above as the input to the function.

```{r, quick-start, warning=F, message=T}

est <- ADMGtmle(a=c(1,0),
                data=data_example_a, 
                graph=graph_a,
                treatment='A', outcome='Y')
```

The code above estimates the ACE of treatment $A$ on outcome $Y$, defined as $E(Y^1)-E(Y^0)$, using the data `data_example_a` generated based on Figure (a). The function `ADMGtmle()` takes the following arguments:
  
- `a`: a vector of length 2, specifying the values of treatment $A$ to compare. For example, `a=c(1,0)` compares causal effect under $A=1$ verse $A=0$. Alternatively, `a` can be input as a single integer if estimating the causal effect under only one treatment level is the goal. For example, to estimate $E(Y^1)$, specify `a = 1`.
- `data`: a data frame containing the data.
- `graph`: a graph object specifying the ADMG.
- `treatment`: a string, specifying the name of the treatment variable.
- `outcome`: a string, specifying the name of the outcome variable.


Alternatively, instead of providing a graph object, users can directly specify the vertices, directed edges, and bi-directed edges within the ADMGtmle() function, as shown below:

```{r, quick-start-option2, warning=F, message=T}

est <- ADMGtmle(a=c(1,0),data=data_example_a, 
                vertices=c('A','M','L','Y','X'), # specify the vertices
                bi_edges=list(c('A','Y')), # specify the bi-directed edges
                di_edges=list(c('X','A'), c('X','M'), c('X','L'),c('X','Y'), c('M','Y'), c('A','M'), c('A','L'), c('M','L'), c('L','Y')), # specify the directed edges
                multivariate.variables = list(M=c('M.1','M.2')), # specify the components of the multivariate variable M
                treatment='A', outcome='Y')
```

# Details on Estimation via Onestep Estimator and TMLE

![](nuisances.jpeg){width=100%}
The package constructs the EIF based onestep estimator and TMLE for ACE through break down the EIF into several nuisance parameters, which falls into two categories: the <span style="color:deeppink">sequential regressions</span> and <span style="color:deeppink">density ratios</span>. The figure above illustrates the decomposition of the EIF into the nuisance parameters using the ADMG in example (a) above.  

To define these nuisance parameters, it is essential to learn the properties of the ADMG. Specifically, we require three definitions:  
1. A topological ordering $\tau$ for variables in the ADMG.  

2. A set $\mathcal{L}$ that contains all the variables that is post the treatment variable according to $\tau$ and is bidirectedly connected to the treatment variable.  

3. A set $\mathcal{M}$ that contains all the variables that is post the treatment variable according to $\tau$ and is not in $\mathcal{L}$.  

The **sequential regressions** are defined for the treatment variable $A$ the outcome variable $Y$ and all the variables between $A$ and $Y$ in $\tau$. Introducing set $\mathcal{L}$ and $\mathcal{M}$ is important because $A$ at those sequential regressions is evaluated at specific level determined by which set the corresponding variable belongs to.  

The **density ratios** are defined for the treatment variable $A$ and all the variables between $A$ and $Y$ in $\tau$. Each density ratio is defined as the ratio of conditional density of a variable. Evaluation of $A$ at these density ratios also depends on which set the corresponding variable belongs to.

## Sequential Regressions
For the sequential regressions, we offer three options for estimation: (1) via linear or logistic regression, (2) via \texttt{SuperLearner}, and (3) via \texttt{SuperLearner} together with cross-fitting.  

- Option 1: Linear or logistic regression. The function offers `formulaY` and `formulaA` to specify the regression model related to outcome $Y$ and treatment $A$, respectively. Users to further specify the link function for these regressions via `linkY_binary` and `linkA`, respectively. Note that `linkY_binary` is only effective when the outcome is binary. The sequential regressions for other variables are fitted via simple linear regression or logistic regressions without interaction and higher order terms.

- Option 2: SuperLearner. The function offers `superlearner.seq`, `superlearner.Y`, and `superlearner.A`, to specify whether to use SuperLearner for the sequential regression, outcome regression, and treatment regression, respectively. The user can further specify the library of SuperLearner via `library.seq`, `library.Y`, `library.A`, respectively.

- Option 3: SuperLearner with cross-fitting. The function offers `crossfit` to specify whether to use cross-fitting in SuperLearner. Users can further specify the number of folds in cross-fitting via `K`. The library of SuperLearner is still specified via `library.seq`, `library.Y`, `library.A`, respectively.

Here we offer a table summary of available methods for sequential regressions.  

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)

data <- data.frame(
  Estimation_method = c(
    "", "", "", 
    "", "", "", "", "", "", "", 
    "", "", ""
  ),
  Arguments = c(
    "`formulaY`", "`formulaA`", "`linkY_binary`", "`linkA`",
    "`superlearner.seq`", "`superlearner.Y`", "`superlearner.A`", "`library.seq`", "`library.Y`", "`library.A`",
    "`crossfit`", "`K`", "`library.xxx`"
  ),
  Explanations = c(
    "Formula for outcome regression", "Formula for treatment regression", "Link function for binary outcome Y in logistic regression", "Link function for binary outcome A in logistic regression",
    "Whether to use SuperLearner for variables between $A$ and $Y$", "Whether to use SuperLearner for outcome Y", "Whether to use SuperLearner for outcome A", 
    "Library of learners for variables between $A$ and $Y$", "Library of learners for $Y$", "Library of learners for $A$",
    "Whether to use cross-fitting along with SuperLearner", "Number of folds in cross-fitting", "Library of SuperLearner is still specified via `library.seq`, `library.Y`, `library.A`, respectively"
  )
)

# Create the table
kable(data, "html", escape = F, col.names = c("Estimation Method", "Arguments", "Explanations"), caption = "Sequential Regressions Estimation Method Details") %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = F) %>%
  row_spec(0, bold = T) %>%
  # add_header_above(c(" " = 1, "Sequential Regressions Estimation Method Details" = 2)) %>%
  pack_rows("Linear or logistic regressions", 1, 4) %>%
  pack_rows("SuperLearner", 5, 10) %>%
  pack_rows("SuperLearner with cross-fitting", 11, 13)
```

The code below is an example of adopting SuperLearner with cross-fitting:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
est <- ADMGtmle(a=c(1,0),
                data=data_example_a, 
                graph = graph_a,
                lib.seq = c("SL.glm", "SL.earth", "SL.ranger", "SL.mean"),
                lib.Y = c("SL.glm", "SL.earth", "SL.ranger", "SL.mean"),
                lib.A = c("SL.glm", "SL.earth", "SL.ranger", "SL.mean"),
                crossfit = TRUE,
                K=5)
```

## Density Ratios
For the density ratios, we provide three options for estimation: (1) via direct estimation using the `densratio` package, (2) via Bayes' rule, and (3) via assuming the density follows a Normal distribution. Note that these methods only apply to the variables between $A$ and $Y$ in $\tau$. It doesn't apply to $A$ since the treatment regression is already estimated in the sequential regressions.

- Option 1: The \link[densratio]{densratio} package. The function calls the \link[densratio]{densratio} package to estimate the density ratio for variables in $\mathcal{L}$ or $\mathcal{M}$ if `ratio.method.L="densratio"` or `ratio.method.M="densratio"`, respectively.

- Option 2: Bayes rule. The function estimates the density ratios for variables in $\mathcal{L}$ or $\mathcal{M}$ via Bayes' rule if `ratio.method.L="bayes"` or `ratio.method.M="bayes"`, respectively. For example, the Bayes' rule method estimate $p(M|a_0,X)/p(M|a_1,X)$ by using the following formula:  


$$
\frac{p(M|a_0,X)}{p(M|a_1,X)} = \frac{p(a_0|M,X)p(M|X)}{p(a_1|M,X)p(M|X)} = \frac{p(a_0|M,X)}{p(a_1|M,X)}.
$$

The regressions involved in this Bayes' formula are estimated following the arguments discussed for sequential regressions.  

- Option 3: Normal distribution. The function estimates the density ratio for variables in $\mathcal{L}$ or $\mathcal{M}$ via assuming normal distribution if `ratio.method.L="dnorm"` or `ratio.method.M="dnorm"`, respectively. The mean of the Normal distribution is estimated via linear regression, and the variance is estimated via the sample variance of the error term from the regression model. Users can specify the formulas for the linear regression for variables in  $\mathcal{L}$ and $\mathcal{M}$ via `dnorm.formula.L` and `dnorm.formula.M`. For example, `dnorm.formula.M=list(M = "M ~ A + X + I(A*X)")`.

Here we offer a table summary of available methods for density ratios.  

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)

data <- data.frame(
  Estimation_method = c(
    '`ratio.method.L="densratio"`', '`ratio.method.M="densratio"`',
    '`ratio.method.L="bayes"`', '`ratio.method.M="bayes"`',
    '`ratio.method.L="dnorm"`', '`ratio.method.M="dnorm"`'
  ),
  Arguments = c(
    "","",
    "","",
    "`dnorm.formula.L`", "`dnorm.formula.M`"
  ),
  Explanations = c(
    "Use `densratio` package to estimate the density ratio for variables in $\\mathcal{L}$", "Use `densratio` package to estimate the density ratio for variables in $\\mathcal{M}$", 
    "Apply the Bayes' rule to estimate the density ratio for variables in $\\mathcal{L}$", "Apply the Bayes' rule to estimate the density ratio for variables in$\\mathcal{M}$",
    "Assuming Normal distributions to estimate the density ratio for variables in $\\mathcal{L}$. The mean of the Normal distributions are estimated via fitting regressions following formula specified in `dnorm.formula.L`", "Assuming Normal distributions to estimate the density ratio for variables in $\\mathcal{M}$. The mean of the Normal distributions are estimated via fitting regressions following formula specified in `dnorm.formula.M`"
  )
)

# Create the table
kable(data, "html", escape = F, col.names = c("Estimation Method", "Arguments", "Explanations"), caption = "Density Ratios Estimation Method Details") %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = F) %>%
  row_spec(0, bold = T) %>%
  # add_header_above(c(" " = 1, "Sequential Regressions Estimation Method Details" = 2)) %>%
  pack_rows("`densratio` package", 1, 2) %>%
  pack_rows("Bayes' rule", 3, 4) %>%
  pack_rows("Normal distribution", 5,6)
```

The code below is an example of using the `dnorm` method for the density ratio estimation for variables in $M\backslash Y$:

```{r, tmle-eg, warning=F, message=F, eval=F}

est <- ADMGtmle(a=c(1,0),
                data=data_example_a, 
                graph = graph_a,
                ratio.method.M = "dnorm")
```


## The TMLE
To construct TMLE, we update the estimated nuisance parameters via a targeting procedure such that the corresponding part of the EIF for each variable is sufficiently small. Sometimes, the targeting procedure requires iterative updates between nuisance parameters. The function `ADMGtmle()` provides several arguments to control for this iterative process:

- `n.iter` specifys the max number of iterations for the targeting procedure. The default value is 500.

- `cvg.criteria` specifies how small the sample mean of the EIF piece for each variable should be to stop the iterative process. The recommendation is $n^{-1/2}$, where $n$ is the sample size.

- `truncate_lower` and `truncate_upper` specify the lower and upper bounds to truncate $p(A=a\mid X)$, for $a\in\{0,1\}$. This helps avoid extreme values of the estimated propensity score.


# Output
As an example, we `ADMGtmle()` to estimate the average counterfactual outcome $E(Y^1)$. The output is described as follows

```{r, output, eval=F}

est <- ADMGtmle(a=1,
                data=data_example_a, 
                graph = graph_a,
                treatment='A', outcome='Y')

# TMLE and Onestep estimator
est$TMLE # a list contains the estimation result from TMLE estimator
est$Onestep # a list contains the estimation result from Onestep estimator

# For either the TMLE or Onestep estimator, the output is a list that contains the following elements:
est$TMLE$estimated_psi # the estimated average counterfactual outcome
est$TMLE$lower.ci # the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval
est$TMLE$upper.ci # the upper bound of the 95% confidence interval
est$TMLE$EIF # the estimated efficient influence function
est$TMLE$EIF.Y # the estimated efficient influence function at the tangent space associated with the outcome
est$TMLE$EIF.A # the estimated efficient influence function at the tangent space associated with the treatment
est$TMLE$EIF.v # the estimated efficient influence function at the tangent space associated with the rest of the variables
est$TMLE$p.a1.mpA # the estimated propensity score for treatment
est$TMLE$mu.next.A # the estimated sequential regression associated with variable that comes right after the treatment according to the topological ordering of the ADMG
est$TMLE$EDstar # mean of the estimated efficient influence function
est$TMLE$iter # iterations take for TMLE estimator to converge
est$TMLE$EDstar.record # the mean of the estimated efficient influence function at each iteration

```

# Functions for learning the properties of ADMG
Apart from the `ADMGtmle()` for causal effec estimation, we also provide functions for learning the properties of ADMG. The functions are described as follows:
  
- `make.graph`: create the graph object. For example, to create the graph object for the ADMG in Figure (a), we can use the following code:

```{r, make-graph, warning=F, message=F, eval=F}

graph_a <- make.graph(vertices=c('A','M','L','Y','X'), # specify the vertices
                bi_edges=list(c('A','Y')), # specify the bi-directed edges
                di_edges=list(c('X','A'), c('X','M'), c('X','L'),c('X','Y'), c('M','Y'), c('A','M'), c('A','L'), c('M','L'), c('L','Y')), # specify the directed edges, with each pair of variables indicating an directed edge from the first variable to the second. For example, c('X', 'A') represents a directed edge from X to A.
                multivariate.variables = list(M=c('M.1','M.2'))) # specify the components of the multivariate variable M

```

- `f.adj_matrix`: return the adjacency matrix of the graph. For example, to get the adjacency matrix of the graph object for the ADMG in Figure (a), we can use the following code:

```{r, f-adj-matrix, warning=F, message=F, eval=F}
f.adj_matrix(graph_a)
```

- `f.top_order`: return the topological ordering of the graph.

```{r, f-top-order, warning=F, message=F, eval=F}
f.top_order(graph_a)
```

- `f.parents`: return the parents of a given vertex or vertices in the graph. For example, to get the parents of vertex `Y` in the graph object for the ADMG in Figure (a), we can use the following code:

```{r, f-parents, warning=F, message=F, eval=F}
f.parents(graph_a, 'Y')
```

- `f.children`: return the children of a given vertex or vertices in the graph. For example, to get the children of vertex `A` in the graph object for the ADMG in Figure (a), we can use the following code:

```{r, f-children, warning=F, message=F, eval=F}
f.children(graph_a, 'A')

```

- `f.descendants`: return the descendants of a given vertex or vertices in the graph. For example, to get the descendants of vertex `A` in the graph object for the ADMG in Figure (a), we can use the following code:

```{r, f-descendants, warning=F, message=F, eval=F}
f.descendants(graph_a, 'A')

```

- `f.district`: return the district of a given vertex or vertices in the graph. For example, to get the district of vertex `A` in the graph object for the ADMG in Figure (a), we can use the following code:

```{r, f-district, warning=F, message=F, eval=F}
f.district(graph_a, 'A')

```

- `cnt.districts`: return the number of districts in the graph.

```{r, cnt-districts, warning=F, message=F, eval=F}
cnt.districts(graph_a)

```

- `f.markov_blanket`: return the Markov blanket of a given vertex or vertices in the graph. For example, to get the Markov blanket of vertex `A` in the graph object for the ADMG in Figure (a), we can use the following code:

```{r, f-markov-blanket, warning=F, message=F, eval=F}
f.markov_blanket(graph_a, 'A')

```

- `f.markov_pillow`: return the Markov pillow of a given vertex or vertices in the graph. For example, to get the Markov pillow of vertex `A` in the graph object for the ADMG in Figure (a), we can use the following code:

```{r, f-markov-pillow, warning=F, message=F, eval=F}
f.markov_pillow(graph_a, 'A')

```

- `is.p.fix`: return whether a treatment variable is primal fixable in a graph object. For example, to check whether the treatment variable `A` is primal fixable in the graph object for the ADMG in Figure (a), we can use the following code:

```{r, is-p-fix, warning=F, message=F, eval=F}
is.p.fix(graph_a, 'A')
```

If the treatment is primal fixable, then the average causal effect of the treatment on any choice of the outcome in the given graph is always identified.

- `is.np.saturated`: return whether a graph object is NP-saturated. For example, to check whether the graph object for the ADMG in Figure (a) is NP-saturated, we can use the following code:

```{r, is-np-saturated, warning=F, message=F, eval=F}
is.np.saturated(graph_a)

```

A graph being nonparametrically saturated means that the graph implies NO equality constraints on the observed data distribution.

- `is.mb.shielded`: return whether a graph is mb-shielded. For example, to check whether ADMG in Figure (a) is shielded, we can use the following code:

```{r, is-mb-shielded, warning=F, message=F, eval=F}
is.mb.shielded(graph_a)

```

A graph being mb-shielded means that the graph only implies ordinary equality constraints on the observed data distribution.
