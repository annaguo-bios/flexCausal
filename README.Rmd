This package is built for estimating the Average Causal Effect (ACE) in graphical models with unmeasured variables. This package is an implementation of the proposed estimators by \red{XXX}, based on the theory of influence functions and targeted minimum loss based estimation (TMLE).

Graphical models with unmeasured variables can be depicted via the Acyclic Directed Mixed Graphs (ADMG). For example, consider the following ADMG, where $A$  is the treatment variable and $Y$ is the outcome variable:

## Installation
To install, run the following code in terminal:

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
# install the devtools package first if it's not yet installed
devtools::install_github("annaguo-bios/ADMGtmle")
```

The source code for `ADMGtmle` package is available on GitHub at [ADMEtmle](https://github.com/annaguo-bios/ADMGtmle/tree/main).

## Quick Start
The main function in this package is `ADMGtmle()`, which estimates the Average Causal Effect (ACE) using both TMLE esetimator and onestep estimator in graphical models with unmeasured variables. To get a flavor of how to use this package, we provide a quick example below:

```{r, quick-start, warning=F, message=F}
library(ADMGtmle) # load the package
head(data_fig_4a) # take a glance of the data, which is a simulated dataset under above figure (a).

est <- ADMGtmle(a=c(1,0),data=data_fig_4a, vertices=c('A','M','L','Y','X'),
                bi_edges=list(c('A','Y')),
                di_edges=list(c('X','A'), c('X','M'), c('X','L'),c('X','Y'), c('M','Y'), c('A','M'), c('A','L'), c('M','L'), c('L','Y')),
                treatment='A', outcome='Y',
                multivariate.variables = list(M=c('M1','M2')))
```
The code above estimates the ACE of treatment $A$ on outcome $Y$, defined as $E(Y^1)-E(Y^0)$, using the data `data_fig_4a` generated based on Figure (a). The function `ADMGtmle()` takes the following arguments:
  
- `a`: a vector of length 2, specifying the values of treatment $A$ to compare. For example, `a=c(1,0)` compares causal effect under $A=1$ verse $A=0$.
- `data`: a data frame containing the data.
- `vertices`: a vector of strings, specifying the names of all vertices in the ADMG.
- `bi_edges`: a list of bi-directed edges in the ADMG.
- `di_edges`: a list of directed edges in the ADMG. For example, `c('X','A')` specifies an edge from $X$ to $A$.
- `treatment`: a string, specifying the name of the treatment variable.
- `outcome`: a string, specifying the name of the outcome variable.
- `multivariate.variables`: a list of variables that are multivariate. For example, `list(M=c('M1','M2'))` specifies that $M$ is a multivariate variable with components $M1$ and $M2$.
